# Runners - .NET MVC Sports Management Application
Runners Runners is a comprehensive sports management application built on the .NET MVC framework, employing a robust architecture based on the principles of Clean Architecture and Repository Pattern. This application is specifically tailored for running sports enthusiasts, offering a feature-rich environment for organizing races, marathons, and establishing running clubs.

### Key Features
- Clean Architecture: Runners is developed using a modular and maintainable architecture that follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns among the Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers. This design promotes code maintainability, testability, and scalability.

- Repository Pattern: The application leverages the Repository Pattern to abstract and centralize data access logic. This promotes a clean and consistent approach to data manipulation, allowing for easy integration with various data sources. In Runners, Entity Framework Core is utilized as the underlying data access technology, ensuring efficient and scalable database operations.

- LINQ: LINQ is employed for expressive and powerful querying capabilities, enabling seamless data retrieval and manipulation. This enhances the efficiency of data processing within the application.
- Entity Framework Core (EF Core): Runners utilizes EF Core as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, providing a high-level and efficient interface for interacting with the database. This ensures optimal data persistence and retrieval, while also supporting migrations for database schema updates.

- SQL Database: The application is backed by a SQL database, offering a reliable and scalable storage solution. The database schema is designed to accommodate the specific requirements of managing races, marathons, and running clubs.
